        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The solution for the N queens problem was achieved using a
          backtracking algorithm that explores all possible configurations of
          queens on the chessboard and eliminates invalid configurations until a
          valid solution is found.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this solution, the values used for the edges and vertices of the
          graph are based on the number of queens in the N queens problem. The
          vertices of the graph represent the columns of the chessboard, and are
          numbered from 0 to N-1. Each vertex is connected to every other vertex
          by an edge, forming a complete graph.
        </p>

        <p>
          To reduce the number of potential solutions, we use the constraint
          that there can only be one queen in each row. We start by placing a
          queen in the first row, and then use the graph to explore all possible
          placements of the remaining queens in the remaining rows. For each
          placement, we check if it is valid by ensuring that no two queens are
          in the same column or on the same diagonal. If a placement is valid,
          we place the queens on the board and return true, indicating that a
          solution has been found. If no solution is found, we return false.
        </p>

        <p>
          The edges of the graph are used to determine the possible placements
          of the next queen based on the positions of the queens that have
          already been placed. For each queen that has been placed, we add an
          edge between its column and every other column that is not in the same
          row or diagonal. This forms a subgraph of the complete graph that
          represents the valid placements for the next queen. We then explore
          each of these valid placements recursively until we find a solution or
          exhaust all possibilities.
